The purpose of this app is to make it convenient to watch YouTube videos based on your itunes library. One must export an xml file from itunes by File->Library->Exmport library. Once loaded one can double clisk on a song and a coverflow will appear that displays the most viewed videos matching that song and artist. Results will be displayed in descending order based on view count. Click outside of the youtube div to remove to current swf element. Navigation can then continue through the coverflow. Click on any song again to requery google.

Robust App [20 pts]
Your web app should work.  It should load and run with no exceptions, and clearly perform some easily-understood task, and it should perform it properly under normal usage.  It also should not crash or hang or otherwise enter some error state, even in the face of undesired input.
-- Coverflow works best in Web-kit browsers and relatively well in mozilla
- adds data from local storage
  
User Interface Design [20 pts]
You should have a reasonably polished user interface with a clean, pleasing visual design, and with intuitive controls and navigation.
-simple design
-coverflow fun to use
  
Effort [20 pts]
Once again:  you are expected to invest at least 10-15 hours into this project, and it is further expected that your project will clearly reflect the quantity and quality of design and craftsmanship that goes along with that much time on this task.
-- ~30 hours put in
 
Code Design / Style [5 pts]
Your project should be divided properly into HTML, CSS, and JS, with clear designs in each.  Your code should abide by all the style guidelines we have discussed in this course.
